# Changelog 1.2

- Cart is fully working
- Now you can checkout and buy in cart with multiple quantities.

# Changelog 1.1

- Cart is running in its simplest form
- Added cart items cannot buyable

# Changelog 1.0

- Login works
- Bookmarks works
- Bookmarks fetched at login
- 1 is admin, 2 and 3 is user.

## Optimization problem

- Fetch user and products once with custom hook. Fetching multiple times makes program run slow.
- Export "type"s globally and reuse them.

# TODO:

- Search in store `pending`
- Visualize cart `COMPLETED`
- Design admin panel to add new product or edit existing products `NEW`
